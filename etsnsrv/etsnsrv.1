.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR etsnsrv (1)
creates an ETSN server. 
The protocols the server supports are the names of any unix domain sockets in the directory specified by 
.B \-dir
(default /tmp/etsn), hereafter $DIR. 
When a request comes in asking for protocol X, 
.BR etsnsrv (1)
opens the file $DIR/X and sends the file descriptor for the TCP connection to the socket X (the in band data will always be the null byte). 
.PP
$DIR should be dedicated to etsnsrv(1). 
Client implementations are free to remove files that have the name of the service they're trying to register. 
.PP
.BR etsnsrv (1)
does not daemonize; use a process supervisor.
